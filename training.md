# 2022 IETF Chairs Training
As a chair or other leader of an IETF Working Group or IRTF Research Group, you are eligible for optional leadership training. The training has been created in consultation with the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), and updated based on feedback received from the chair training sessions conducted last year.

Three live training classes will be offered twice each to accommodate participants in different timezones. You only need to participate in one session of any class, and you do not need to participate in all classes. Each class session is scheduled for 1 hour.

> Registration is open until Tuesday, 22 November
