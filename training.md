# IETF Chairs Training

## Live training 2023

Any IETF participant is encouraged to enroll in these classes, whether they are:
+ currently serving as a chair, 
+ considering serving as a chair, or 
+ curious about what the role of group chair entails.

These courses offer information and insights to encourage contribution, resolve conflict, and reach consensus for groups you lead or participate in. 

Among the most highly rated aspects of past editions, is the opportunity to meet and interact with other participants.


Three live training classes will be offered twice each to accommodate participants in different timezones. You only need to participate in one session of any class, and you do not need to participate in all classes. Each class session is scheduled for 1 hour.

Registration is open until the day before each session; please register for only one session of each class in which you wish to participate:

### Promoting Contribution
Encouraging input from meeting participants and ensuring all viewpoints are heard. The class will review different leadership mindset models (The Growth Mindset, The Inclusive Mindset, The Agile Mindset), as well as ways to manage mailing lists and participant personality types in the context of IETF groups. Interactive exercises and discussions are an integral part of the class.
