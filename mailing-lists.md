IETF mailing lists are the primary discussion forums for IETF Working Groups. While groups may also use in-person or online meetings, and platforms such as GitHub to raise, suggest or discuss issues initially, these should be brought to the WG mailing list so that a group position can be determined.

IETF Working Group lists are generally open to anyone with an email address.

## General information and resources

### Mailing lists
Addresses of Working Group lists (as well as information about WG charters and other roles) are provided at:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/WGNAME/email/

Where "WGNAME" is replaced by the Working Group abbreviation.

### Mailing list archives
Archives of IETF Working Groups are publicly available. A searchable repository is available via the [IETF Mail Archive site](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/).

## Uses of Working Group mailing list
Beyond discussion of relevant topics and documents relevant to a particular working group, Working Group email lists are used to:
- Announce WG interim meetings
- Announce WG sessions at IETF meeting notes
- Share meeting notes

Sometimes, working group sub-tasks may benefit from dedicated mailling lists. In those cases, then a non-WG email list should be created following the [non-WG emailing list guidelines](https://www.ietf.org/participate/lists/nonwglist-guidelines/).

## List management
List owners and moderators can manage message moderation and subscribers by visiting the the main webpage for a list, which takes the form (for ietf.org lists) of:

`https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/lists/LISTNAME@ietf.org/`

You will need first to [claim the address](https://www.ietf.org/participate/lists/#managing) used for a particular list. If a chair is not listed as an owner, request support@ietf.org to update the owners accordingly.

### Moderation
Lists can be moderated by logging into the [IETF Postorius interface](https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/) and visiting the moderation page for the list.

Once logged in, you can see all lists for which you have a moderator role by visiting:

`https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/lists/?role=moderator`

The moderation queue for a specific list can be found via the GUI

![mailman3-moderation_options-new.png](/mailman3-moderation_options-new.png)

or by following the pattern:

`https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/lists/LISTNAME@EXAMPLE.EXAMPLE/held_messages`

The IESG has provided [guidance on moderating IETF WG mailing lists](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/mailing-lists-moderation/).

### Managing subscribers

Subscribers can be managed via the Postorius interface:

![mailman3-moderation_options.png](/mailman3-subscription_options.png)

or, for subscription requests, by following the pattern:

`https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/lists/LISTNAME@EXAMPLE.EXAMPLE/subscription_requests`

### Dealing with disruptive posting
Further information about dealing with disruptive posting is needed.

## Other mailing lists
You may occasionally require a [nonâ€“Working Group email list](https://datatracker.ietf.org/list/nonwg) to support the working group, for example for a focused design team. Please refer to the [guidelines for non-Working Group email lists](https://www.ietf.org/participate/lists/nonwglist-guidelines/) for more information, including how to request one.
