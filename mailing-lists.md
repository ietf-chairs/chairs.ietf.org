IETF mailing lists are the primary discussion forums for IETF Working Groups. While groups may also use in-person or online meetings, and platforms such as GitHub to raise, suggest or discuss issues initially, these should be brought to the WG mailing list so that a group position can be determined.

IETF Working Group lists are generally open to anyone with an email address.

## General information and resources

### Mailing lists
Addresses of Working Group lists (as well as information about WG charters and other roles) are provided at:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/WGNAME/email/

Where "WGNAME" is replaced by the Working Group abbreviation.

### Mailing list archives
Archives of IETF Working Groups are publicly available. A searchable repository is available via the [IETF Mail Archive site](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/).

## Uses of Working Group mailing list
Beyond discussion of relevant topics and documents relevant to a particular working group, Working Group email lists are used to:
- Announce WG interim meetings
- Announce WG sessions at IETF meeting notes
- Share meeting notes

Sometimes, working group sub-tasks may benefit from dedicated mailling lists. In those cases, then a non-WG email list should be created following the [non-WG emailing list guidelines](https://www.ietf.org/how/lists/nonwglist-guidelines/).

## List management
Further information about WG list management is needed.

### Moderation
The IESG has provided [guidance on moderating IETF WG mailing lists](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/mailing-lists-moderation/).

### Managing subscribers
Further information about managing WG list subscribers is needed.

### Dealing with disruptive posting
Further information about dealing with disruptive posting is needed.

### Updating email addresses
The email address used to subscribe to IETF mailing lists may be [updated globally](https://www.ietf.org/how/lists/) for all email addresses.

## Other mailing lists
You may occasionally require a [nonâ€“Working Group email list](https://datatracker.ietf.org/list/nonwg) to support the working group, for example for a focused design team. Please refer to the [guidelines for non-Working Group email lists](https://www.ietf.org/participate/lists/nonwglist-guidelines/) for more information, including how to request one.
