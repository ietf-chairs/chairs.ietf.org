Welcome to a resource site for chairs and others providing leadership and support for [IETF Working Groups](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/) (WGs) and [IRTF](https://www.irtf.org) [Research Groups](https://irtf.org/groups).	General information and resources are provided on this page, below. Additional information is grouped by key WG chair tasks—[managing mailing lists](/mailing-lists), [managing documents](/documents), [organizing meetings](/meetings), and [supporting participants](/participants)—and available via the left-side menu items on each page.

> NOTE: Issues and suggestions can be made via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ietf/chairs.ietf.org), or by sending email to [support@ietf.org](mailto:support@ietf.org)
