1. Start an adoption call on the working group mailing list. After that you can indicate that an adoption call has been issued. 

1. When logged in as WG Navigate to the document in the IET Datatracker and click the “Manage adoption” button.

1. Select the desired working group from the "Group" dropdown menu. 

1. Select “Call for Adoption By WG Issued (IETF)” from the “State” dropdown menu.

When an adoption call is successfully concluded, it is time to update the document state in the IETF Datatracker. Usually, a new revision of the document is required after an adoption call is concluded. To indicate that the document is adopted, you can update the Datatracker state to reflect this.

1. Navigate to the document in the IETF Datatracker and click the “Edit” button next to “WG state” label.

2. Move the document to the next state, in this case “Adopted by a WG”

Authors

Approve the document.

Make sure that “replaced by” is set.

Once the updated revision of the document has been submitted, set the state to “WG Document”.
