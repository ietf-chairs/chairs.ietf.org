As a chair, you are strongly encouraged to test your setup, especially screen sharing, before any group session, especially if it has been a while since you or any presenter has used Meetecho as changes in browsers, operating systems, and Meetecho features may change.

## Online testing anytime

As an IETF Working Group chair, you can use the [Meetecho Session Scheduler](https://meetings.conf.meetecho.com/scheduler) to set up a test session at your convenience between or leading up to IETF meetings. More detail is available in the [Meetecho Guide for Chairs](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/technology/meetecho-guide-chairs/)

## In-person testing at IETF meeting
An example session room is usually available at the IETF meeting venue for onsite session chairs and participants to test their setups ahead of the start of meeting sessions. The room will include the typical set up for all sessions during the IETF meeting week.

> For [IETF 116](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/116/), testing will be available:
> 12:00-17:00 (JST) on 26 March 2023
> Room G316 of the PACIFICO North venue.
