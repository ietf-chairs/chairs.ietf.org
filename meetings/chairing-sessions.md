## Note Well 

The Note Well should be reviewed at the start of any IETF meeting. The [Note Well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/) is available online, including in a variety of slide formats.

## Working Group/BOF Rosters ("Blue Sheets")

Please remember to circulate the blue sheets for your session so that participants may register their attendance at the ssssion.

If they are not already on the provided clipboards, blue sheets can be found in the translucent colored folders at the head table. Please do not remove these folders from the room; they contain the blue sheets for sessions that will be held in this room after your group. 

At the end of your session, please turn the blue sheets into the Secretariat at the meeting registration desk. After registration closes on Friday, please turn in blue sheets to the Secretariat office. (The location of the Secretariat office will be posted at the registration desk on Friday.)

Please DO NOT remove the clipboards from the meeting room. They will be needed in the session that has the room after your group.

Please send a trouble ticket to tickets@meeting.ietf.org or visit the Help Desk. Please be as specific as possible in your message. If you are unable to send email, please visit the Help Desk (usually near the IETF Registration desk). 

## Presentation Slides 

Please encourage all presenters to upload meeting slides to the IETF Datatracker prior to the meeting. (See the [organizing meetings page](https://chairs.ietf.org/en/meetings) for more information.)

For materials you do not receive prior to the meeting, please take a few minutes to upload them at the very start of the meeting. This is particularly helpful to remote participants since while they can follow the discussion via the Jabber room and audio stream, they cannot view meeting slides unless those slides have been uploaded. 

## Zulip
At the start of the meeting, please ask if someone in the room is willing to act as "scribe" for the Zulip stream. 

The scribe should then join the conference room, and type a running commentary as to what's going on in the room (e.g. if a speaker makes a presentation, the scribe types the URL for the presentation into the Jabber room). 

During question time, a remote participant can type a question into the room and the scribe will pass it on to the speaker.

## Audio Streaming 

The audio streaming can only pick up sound from directly around the microphone, so it is important both that you speak directly into the microphone and also that you remind any meeting participants that they must come up to the microphone if they want to speak. 

## Preparing for Proceedings 

The deadline to submit all materials is posted on the [Important Dates webpage](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/important-dates/). Please use the IETF Meeting Materials Management Tool to submit your materials. 

Minutes may be submitted in TXT, HTML, Markdown, or PDF formats. Submission of minutes is mandatory.

Slides may be submitted in PDF, PPT, or PPTX formats. Submission of slides is strongly encouraged. When submitting multiple presentations, please indicate the order that the presentations should appear in the proceedings.
