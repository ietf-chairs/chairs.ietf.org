1. Start an adoption call in the mailing list of your working group. (see [this example](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/spring/bC72m92iVuyGiUUzmPEgD8IoORs/) )

2. Indicate in the IETF Datatracker that an adoption call has been issued by navigating to the I-D and clicking "Manage adoption"

5. When an adoption call is successfully concluded on the WG mailing list, it is time to update the I-D state in the Datatracker. (Usually, a new revision of the document is required after an adoption call is concluded.) To indicate that the I-D is adopted, navigate to the I-D in Datatracker and click the “Edit” button next to “WG state” label.

6. Move the document to the next state, in this case “Adopted by a WG”

7. Contact authors to request a new version with updated [I-D name](https://authors.ietf.org/en/naming-your-internet-draft). 

8. (Pre-)Approve the document. Make sure that “replaced by” is set.

9. Once the updated revision of the I-D has been submitted, set the state to “WG Document”.
