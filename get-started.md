Whether this is your first time chairing a working group or if you have chaired a working group previously the tips, information, and resources below can help make chairing easier and more effective.

- Consider your co-chair(s) and Area Directors to be part of your team. 
Area Directors, and the IESG in general, want your working group to be successful!

- Familiarize yourself with [roles that support and complement the work of chairs](https://www.ietf.org/participate/roles/)
There are many defined roles that complement especially:
  - Area Director
  - Document shepherds
  - Document editors
  - Group Session notetaker
  - Session scribe
  - Working group secretary
  - Working group consultant
  - Working group designate
- Review the IETF chairs training on-demand courses
These courses were developed specifically for IETF group chairs with input from current and past chairs, as well as Area Directors, to help run effective working groups.

- Subscription to the Working Groups Chairs list
You are signed up for wgchairs@ietf.org automatically. This is the place to ask questions and offer ideas to your fellow chairs. It is also the place where information specifically for chairs is shared, such as details about upcoming IETF meetings.

- Review and update your IETF Datatracker profile
As a working group chair, it is helpful if your Datatracker profile biography–which you can edit yourself–is up to date. If you’d like to update your photo, please send the request along with the picture to support@ietf.org 
- Acquaint yourself (anew) with the IETF Datatracker
As a chair, the IETF Datatracker is the day-to-day front-end for getting various working group tasks done, such as scheduling interim meetings, updating the description of your group, and more.
